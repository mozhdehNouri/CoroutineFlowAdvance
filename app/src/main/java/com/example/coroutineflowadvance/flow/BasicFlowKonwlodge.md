what is the flow ?

Flow is a new Kotlin asynchronous stream library that is built on top of Kotlin coroutines. A flow
can emit multiple values instead of a single value and over a period of time. Kotlin Flow is ideal
to use when you need to return multiple values asynchronously, such as automatic updates from your
data source.

Flows are ideal for the parts of your application that involve live data updates.

Flows emit multiple values of the same type one at a time.
