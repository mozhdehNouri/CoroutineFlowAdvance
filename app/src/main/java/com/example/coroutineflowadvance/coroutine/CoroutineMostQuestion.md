what are threads?

Coroutines in the context of Android development (or Kotlin specifically)
are a concurrency design pattern used to simplify asynchronous
programming. They are not exactly a framework for managing threads, though
they interact with them. Let’s break down your queries:

**1. Coroutines and Threads:**  
Coroutines are lightweight threads. They are managed by the Kotlin runtime
and scheduled by a dispatcher on existing threads. A coroutine itself
doesn’t correspond directly to a system thread but instead uses the
existing thread pool managed by Kotlin. This allows them to be more
lightweight and scalable than traditional threads.

**2. The Number of Coroutines:**  
You can launch many coroutines (thousands or even more) because they are
very lightweight. They leverage a small number of threads to perform
operations. The actual limit depends on the workload you’re doing in each
coroutine and the memory available to your application.

**3. Executing Coroutines in a Thread:**  
Coroutines can be launched within a single thread or among multiple
threads, managed by a Dispatcher that determines what runs where. They use
suspension to avoid blocking the thread on which they run. When a
coroutine suspends, it doesn’t block the thread but frees it to run other
coroutines.

**4. Sequential Execution in Threads:**  
While coroutines may run in the context of a thread, they can suspend and
resume without blocking the actual thread. This means that one thread can
execute many tasks sequentially without waiting for each task to complete,
thus making efficient use of the thread.

**5. What Is a Thread?**  
A thread is a fundamental unit of CPU utilization. It represents a single
sequence of execution within a program. In the context of an operating
system, a thread is the smallest sequence of programmed instructions that
can be managed independently. Threads are a way to provide application
concurrency, potentially running different parts of a program in parallel
on multi-core processors.

So, to put it simply, coroutines can be thought of as a way to write
asynchronous and non-blocking code in a sequential fashion, which uses
threads underneath but abstracts away most of the complexity of managing
them directly. They allow high concurrency without the high costs
generally associated with threads.
